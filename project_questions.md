#### Report- overall percentage-based table

- Are percent values (numbered columns) supposed to represent the percentage of customers from each cohort that stayed enrolled (were retained) over the following months?
- Can I assume that if a `customer_id` has orders in the months following their first purchase, they can be considered "retained" for that month? (repeat customer rate)
- Does `subscription_type` have anything to do w/ retention
- I'm getting an error "while reading table": "Found corrupted data while opening file". Query still works fine. Will this cause problems when connecting to Data Studio?
