#### Retention

How is it calculated?

- If a returning customer makes their second purchase within the first two months of their first, they are considered retained.
  - For example: John, Tim and Sally all make their first purchases in January. John makes his second purchase a week later (still in January), Tim makes his second purchase in February and Sally makes her second purchase in March. John and Tim's future purchases would be counted towards +1, +2... retention, while Sally's wouldn not.

#### LTV
